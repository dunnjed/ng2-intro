# ng2-intro

This repo contains my progress working through the [Angular 2 tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). It uses webpack based on the [Introduction to Webpack](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html) section on the Angular 2 website.

See working demo [here](https://ng2-intro.firebaseapp.com/) (access requires login with Google credentials).
